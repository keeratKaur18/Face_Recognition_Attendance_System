# Face_Recognition_Attendance_System
## Description
This is a Face Recognition Attendance Web based application which detects and recognizes faces by comparing the encodings to the encodings of the input images and systematically prints the names and time of detection on the click of a button!

## Problem Statement
Attendance is an important part of daily classroom evaluation. At the beginning and ending of
class, it is usually checked by the teacher, but it may appear that a teacher may miss someone or some students answer multiple times or it may so be that the student is required to manually sign the sheet every time they attend a class. This includes more time consumed by the students to find their name on sheet, some students may mistakenly sign another studentâ€™s name and sometimes the sheet may get lost.
Face recognition-based attendance system is a problem of recognizing face for taking attendance by using face recognition technology based on highdefinition monitor video and other information technology.

## Working Of Model




## Prerequisites
Libraries/Packages:

- OpenCV-python
- numpy
- face_recognition (requires installing dlib and cmake libraries)
- streamlit
- requests
- pandas
- pyttsx3 (text to speech)
- streamlit_lottie


All of these external libraries and packages are required in order to run my code. 
OpenCV will mainly be used for their face cascade, face detector and video capture.
face_recognition will be used for taking face encodings and face locations.
Streamlit library has been used for building the web page.




## Executing Program
The following statement can be typed in the terminal for the web app to run on local host

` streamlit run attendance.py`
